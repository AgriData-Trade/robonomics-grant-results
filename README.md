This repository is designed to submit reports on completed tasks within the Robonomics Grant Program (so-called Grant Diary), as well as to provide the final results obtained under the grant. The application process for the Robonomics Grant Program is described [here](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-program).

## :pencil2: General Recommendations

When generating reports and results, we strongly encourage you to adhere to the following rules and guidelines.

* All results should be presented in English.
* In order to successfully receive grant funding for your proposal it is necessary for the project to have open source code and open access materials. We prefer BSD-3-Clause license, but others or Unlicense are also acceptable. For scientific articles it is acceptable to use <https://arxiv.org/>.
* Take care to properly design and document your code. Unless absolutely necessary, make the documentation public as well, ideally as part of the appropriate code repository.
* All developed software should be accompanied by guides for installation, configuration and minimum launch for tests.
* Algorithms, methods and calculations should be adequately described so that they can be repeated and verified.
* When creating graphs, tables and lists, you should adhere to an academic style of design.
* We encourage the use of TeX for reports and documents.
* Make sure your videos are well-designed and they are available for watching.
* Examples of typical platforms for publishing results: [IPFS](https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/), [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/intl/en/docs/about/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## :notebook: Grant Diary Process

During the work on the project, you should provide **every two weeks** the Grant Diary, which briefly (up to one A4 page) describes the intermediate results obtained in your project. The first report should be published 2 weeks after the date on which your proposal was accepted by Robonomics team (the date of the merged commit of the proposal). 

The process for submitting and reviewing a diary is as follows:

1. **Preparing the Grant Diary**
    1. Fork this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the initial proposal.
    2. Create a copy of the ([`diaries/grant-diary-template.md`](diaries/grant-diary-template.md)) in the newly created fork. If you are using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-results/main/diaries/grant-diary-template.md) of the template inside the new one. **Warning:** *do not modify the template file directly*.
    3. Rename the copy with the name of the project as `project_name-grant-diary.md`.
    4. Complete the template with details about progress over the past two weeks (up to one A4 page). Specify the date of report, the rest of design is at your discretion.
    5. After that, create a pull request.
2. **Grant Diary Review**
    1. If necessary, members of Robonomics team can issue comments on the diary if they have any questions.
    2. Then we will merge your pull request to accept the Grant Diary.

Subsequent reports are sent in the same file (`project_name-grant-diary.md`) in a similar manner. You shall describe the newly created reports in the file above the previous ones. 

Please note that the **grant may be terminated** early if you refuse to complete the Grant Diary or respond to our comments or your reports clearly do not meet the terms of the proposal;

## :package: Result Delivery Process

By the end of the grant, you should provide the results of the project in accordance with the proposal. The process for submitting the results is as follows:

1. **Preparing the Results**
    1. To send the results, you should use the previosly forked the Robonomics Grant Results GitHub repository (for the Grant Diary) with the same Github account, used to submit the initial proposal.
    2. Create a copy of the ([`results/grant-results-template.md`](results/grant-results-template.md)). If you are using the GitHub web interface, you will need to create a new file and copy the [contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-grant-results/main/results/grant-results-template.md) of the template inside the new one. **Warning:** *do not modify the template file directly*.
    3. Rename the copy with the name of the project as `project_name-grant-results.md`.
    4. Complete the template with the deliverables of your project. 
    5. After that, create a pull request.
2. **Acceptance of Results**
    1. If necessary, members of Robonomics team can issue comments on the results if they have any questions.
    2. Then we will merge your pull request to accept the results. 

The date of the merged commit is considered the end of the grant.
